The main features: fine lines, wrinkles, age spots, sunny lentigo, enlarged vascular (couperose).</p><h2>Photorejuvenation BBL</h2><p>The BBL system emits powerful light energy of a certain range. Depending on the prevalence of a particular problem, the doctor will select the necessary range and power of the procedure. Light energy is absorbed by certain targets: in the case of pigmentation, the target is melanin, with dilated vessels (rosacea), hemoglobin is the target, with wrinkles the effect is directed to collagen and elastin.</p><p>In addition to eliminating photodamaging, photorejuvenation can slow down the process of skin aging</p><p>Sciton's BBL rejuvenation system, USA is the best system because it allows achieving results at capacities 2-3 times lower than on IPL systems, as a result of which BBL has a large safety margin with the same therapeutic effects (performance indicators). IPL systems cannot achieve such efficiency because they are forced to raise powers, which often causes burns, but not good results of the treatment. After a quality procedure, you will feel that the skin has changed for the better. This is noticeably fast enough - already two weeks after the treatment.</p><p>Sciton BBL is the only system in the world that has clinically proven skin rejuvenation results.</p><h2 id="whattoexpect">What to expect?</h2><p>You will pigments spots and brocken vessels desapiring during first days after treatment. Photorejuvenation is a treatment for those patients who want to prophylactically care for the skin, slowing down aging without negative effects on the body and would not like to resort to surgical interventions in the future, for those who are wary of invasive procedures and at the same time strives to look perfect.</p><p class="msg msg--success">With regular Forever Young BBL treatments, you can slow down aging and look much younger than your peers! Forever Young BBL differs from BBL photorejuvenation in more pronounced ANTI-AGING EFFECT. With regular procedures, there is a slowdown skin aging. If patients undergo a course of procedures from year to year, then their skin looks younger in comparison with peers. There are 10-year clinical studies that clearly demonstrate the slowdown of age-related processes in the skin. Read more in the Forever Young BBL section.</p><h3>Photorejuvenation and other treatments combination</h3><p>Photorejuvenation is combined with all aesthetic procedures, it is only necessary to observe the correct sequence and intervals. There is an unfounded opinion that laser and photorejuvenation procedures, including, are not combined with injection techniques - fillers, dysport, botox and mesotherapy. We hasten to please our patients that there are clinical studies that prove BBL rejuvenation does not affect fillers. Therefore, the combination of photorejuvenation with other procedures, on the contrary, will allow, in addition to equalizing skin tone and texture, to obtain a complex aesthetic effect.</p><p>If injection procedures are expected, then first you should do a photorejuvenation course, and then injection procedures. If the injection methods are performed by the course, then it is recommended to undergo the procedure 14 days after the injection.</p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on March 11, 2021</div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="./authors/nichename/" title="nichename">nichename</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="./stretch-marks-correction.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Stretch marks correction</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="./">Asthalin</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by <a href="https://postsprout.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
